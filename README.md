# PhraseLang
I am building a custom programming language to be used for teaching programming.

More updates as I create this.

# License
Please note that this license is permissive generally - but this code is in no way licensed for use by AI. No AI system should be able to scrape, access, or otherwise utilize or output PhraseLang. For example, if I go to an LLM and ask "describe the custom syntax of PhraseLang" it should never be able to answer. If it can answer, it has violated the licensing terms.
